1. Checking valid input => DONE

First thing to do, before initializing is to check the
program input.
- The prog. will receive 4/5 arguments => Managing if we receive more
or less than 4/5 args.

Let's analyze the input : 
- 5 — The number of philosophers
- 800 — The time a philosopher will die if he doesn’t eat
- 200 — The time it takes a philosopher to eat
- 200 — The time it takes a philosopher to sleep
- 7 — Number of times all the philosophers need to eat before terminating the program **

=> We need to check : 
- that the input contain only nb
- nb should be bigger than 0 (all) except the nb of meals each philo need to eat.
- Limit to 200 philos max ! (check the correction)

2. Structures

Each philo needs to be a thread & all the data needs to pass
to the routine functions ! + RECODER USLEEP !!

He created 2 structures : 
- The prog. struct. which holds all of the philos (in an array),
3 mutex & one dead_flag.
- The philo structure where we have all of the general data,
3 mutex pointers that point to the mutex in the 1st struct.,
2 mutex pointers for the forks & on dead pointer which points
to the dead flag in the prog. struct.

3. Initializaton : + CREATE a thread that will monitor everything.
Memory on the stack =>
initializing a philo structure array, a mutex array for the forks 
and the program structure all in the main. From there I initialize 
the program variables, initialize all the mutexes for the mutex 
fork array, and lastly the philosophers — input variables and point 
the pointers to all the mutexes and the dead_flag.

for (int i = 0; i < params->number_of_philosophers; i++)
    {
        params->philosophers[i].id = i + 1;
        params->philosophers[i].left_fork = &params->forks[i];
        params->philosophers[i].right_fork = &params->forks[(i + 1) % params->number_of_philosophers];
        params->philosophers[i].last_meal_time = get_timestamp();
        params->philosophers[i].meals_eaten = 0;
        params->philosophers[i].params = params;
        pthread_create(&params->philosophers[i].thread, NULL, philosopher_routine, &params->philosophers[i]);
    }

WARNING : 
1. You create your threads (one for each philo) in the loop
2. Then you join it
3. In "routine" function we will create another thread for each
philo that we will detach in order to monitore the state
of each philo.


4. Thread creation, Philo routine & monitor.
Now we need to create the threads and join them. We will create 
as many threads as philosophers we have, each philo needs to be a 
thread and we will create an extra thread (I called it observer) 
which will monitor everything. Each philo thread will run the philo 
routine function and the observer will run the monitor function.

WARNING : each time your philo is doing something you lock
just before, then print your message & unlock when the action
is over !

---------- Philo routine ---------
IMPORTANT INFO :
To pass the info of the struct. we have to
declare a var. of our struct & give it (as a "value") the
param (casted) of the routine function !!!

The routine will be the function executed over and over by the philos,
Basically ,I created a loop that will break as soon as the dead flag is 1, 
in other words as soon as a philo is dead.

In our loop they will eat, sleep & think : 
THINK =>
when they think we just need to print a message
“X is thinking” (X is the philo number)

SLEEP =>
When they sleep we need to make them sleep the length of the input 
inserted by the user using our ft_usleep (described in the bottom 
of this page) and then print the message “X is sleeping”.

EAT =>
We will lock the right fork first using pthread_mutex_lock 
and print the message, and do the same with the left fork.
Then he will eat using ft_usleep again and only then he will
drop the forks by unlocking the locks, before that we change
some variables that give our monitor indications but that’s the general idea.

---------- Monitor --------
This thread will be running and monitoring the whole program, it has 2 checks
in it that run infinitely until a philo dies or they all ate the number of
meals they need to (last input argument). Basically, we will check that the
time a philo needs to die didn’t surpass the last meal he had and that he is
not concurrently eating. If he indeed died we change the dead flag to 1 and
that will break the loop in all of the threads. The other check is to see if
all the philos finished eating the amount of meals they need to, and if they
did we will again change the dead flag to one and break the threads loop.


5. Destroying all the mutexes
The last step is to Destroy all the mutexes you initialized, otherwise,
they won’t work. In this step, we will free all the data we allocated
if we chose to allocate it(we didn’t).


a. Techniques pour Éviter les Deadlocks
Ordre de Prise des Fourchettes :
Assurez-vous que les philosophes prennent les fourchettes dans un ordre fixe.

WARNING : 
- Necessaire de creer 2 threads par philosophe (un de plus pour
checker la mort du philo sinon il attend indéfiniment qu'il termine).
- Créer un autre thread pour informer les autres (philo) qu'un philo est dead.
